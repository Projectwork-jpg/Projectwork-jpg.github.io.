            Water Safety should be your main concern when going out on the water. For you and your group. Everyone should have a life jacket and a helmet. Each person's life jacket should be on tight but not tight enough to restrict breathing. Similar to their helmet making sure it's not loose enough to roll on the users head. The leader of the group should have a first aid kit to cover injuries such as impales, gashes and cuts. The leader should also carry a throw line.

            In the event of a capsize the situation to resue the cap sized person varies. On flat water you approach the person slowly making sure they are calm. Then they can hold on to the back of your boat and you can tow them to shore. In rivers you have to get out of you boat quickly and onto the shore. Then you throw the throw line line as they are being carried by the current. Be sure to compensate for the current and throw the line slightly in front of them.
